## The platform header

The header is provided to "fake" the Checkmate look in apps that have not yet been checkmated. The header includes areas for apps to include navigation adn dropdown functionality to commonly needed items while retaining the platform design standards.

More information about the Rails API for the header can be foudn here: [https://github.com/mdsol/sandman/blob/develop/doc/header/header.md](https://github.com/mdsol/sandman/blob/develop/doc/header/header.md)

The platform header contains important elements such as logos, help and user menus, and platform-wide navigation. For this reason, it is not advisable, or permitted, to alter the header per application.
